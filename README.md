# Windows Activator
#This program kinda sucks compared to MAS, so just use MAS.
This program can activate just about ANY version of Windows.

It's only one file that does it all! The *exe* does the same thing as the *bat*. I recommended using the *bat* version, as Windows' antivirus really hates the *exe* version.
